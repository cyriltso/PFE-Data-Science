# Data Science : UEFA UCL 2018-2019 winner prediction

## Introduction & Purpose

In this project, we want to predict the winner of UEFA Champions League 2018/2019.

## Contents

In the Master's branch:
  - all the codes for the webscraping part
  - all the codes for the cleaning part
  - all the codes for the analysis part
  - all the conclusions made
  - the data roadmap and the schedule of the project

In the Test's branch:
  - all the codes that have been used for testing
  - several experiment of different webscraping methods

## How are we going to proceed ?

1. Scraping the necessary data by parsing several website, then merged those contents into Databases.
2. Storing the data to CSV file (maybe migrating it to SQL file later)
3. Cleaning the Database in order to avoir redundancy
4. Analyzing the data per criteria, establishing correlations between features
5. Building the predictive models with Machine Learning algorithms
6. Conclusion and Storytelling
